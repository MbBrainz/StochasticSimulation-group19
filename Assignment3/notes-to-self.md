# Notes to remember from last assignment:
- Use pandas.DataFrame for all data collection -> very convenient
- Build df save function that saves simulation data in .csv and a corresponding .json dictionary with general stats
- Use "read if available or simulate" statements
- Apply versioning of classes to label data
- save images as SVG/PDF -> vector files
